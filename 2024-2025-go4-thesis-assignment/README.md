# Thesis as a webpage assignment

## The assignment

- Conceptualize, design and code a web version of your thesis in the form of a one-pager website.
- Work with code in your website sketching process (we won't look at your .pdf or 'indesign' website sketches proposal).
- Publish (deploy) it on the KABK's GitHub repo.
- Ensure it is archivable on the university's *researchcatalogue.net*.

## Class structure

### Planning

- **Schedule**: (almost) **every Monday**, from **December 4th** up to **March 4th**, from **9h** to **17h30**.
- **Duration**: **9 classes** spread on 15 weeks.
- **Deadline**: presentation on **Thursday March 11th**.

### Activities

- December classes (**4th, 11th, 18th**), workshop structure, reviewing and expanding on coding notions for the assignment
- From January: mostly Individual feedback classes (**sign-up** sheet, **15 minutes individual slots**) on most classes.
- ... but the possibility of making small groups feedback (4-5 people, sign-up sheet, 60 minutes) as well.
- **Self-directed** (if not meeting for feedback, you'd be expected to advance/work on your project)
- In order to pass, attendance is set at 7 classes out of 9 (80%). This means you'll meet to attend most classes in December, while as well meet with each of us from January **at least twice**.

### Working methodology

Questions to ask **soon**:

- Which **types of content** would my thesis website need to accomodate? Lots of visual materials, maybe videos, or audio? Most likely some levels of headings, and maybe a table of contents?
- Which **type of writing / tone?** An academic research will command an appropriate use of footnotes. Something akin of a *deambulation* at the edges of theory and fiction might have looser or expressive typographic elements.
- What are my **actual abilities**, in relation to this assignment? **You don't need to be an advanced coder to succeed the assignment**, what is important is to come up with a proposal up to your abilities that **deserves your content**.

Questions to ask **at some point later**:

- **How can my topic translate into visual design choices?** Shall my topic translate into visual design choices? Which types of ingredients can I play with (*color, typography, layout, interaction patterns...*).
- Which **types of functionalities** could enrich my visitor/reader's experience while being true to **being true to my content**?
- Are my design choices **appropriate for any screen sizes**? Would my website be accessible to most users and most usage contexts?

Questions to ask **before delivering your project**:

- **Bring your thesis website for a test drive**. Navigate on your website and reflect on your 'user' experience. Also **let your friends try your website, and observe them while doing it**. Criterias to take into account: *intuitive patterns, loads fast, optimized content and media, legible sizes depending on screen sizes, right timing for animations and transitions, accessible...* Based on these experiences, see remaining details that can be improved.
- Can my thesis website be **archived** through the university research portal (assignment requirement)? In most circumstances it will be, you will need to make sure your website is *static* (as self-contained *html* document with its contained ressources), and be mindful about how you use *Javascript* (if you use it).

### Milestones

↓ (December) You attend most classes, you do the activities, and you're familiar with the general structure of a one-pager website. <br>
↓ (January) You are organizing your working content for the assignment (placeholder materials). <br>
↓ (January) You're familiar with your thesis topic and your angle of research, you have conceptual ideas of *potentialities*. <br>
↓ (end January) You've started working on your website, sketching in code. <br>
↓ (from February 1st) You are fully committed to **coding/developing your actual thesis webpage.** <br>
↓ (mid February) Your website is structurally sound, you are now adjusting elements more precisely. <br>
↓ (end February) You have your actual content in the website. <br>
↓ (March) You are debugging / fine-tuning details across several screen sizes (mobile/desktop), and you are deploying on GitHub. <br>
↓ (mid March) (presentation deadline) **Your website is online (yay!)**

## Thesis landing page (non-graded)

- We'll need a small group to make a landing page for this year's theses. As examples, here are the landing pages of [2023](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-23/), [2022](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-22/), [2021](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-21/), [2020](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-20/), and [2019](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19/). It would be nice to have this sorted out for the **end of February**.
