# Describing web experiences

A quick exercice about looking at and describing web experiences

## 1) Show us a coding project you realized in your previous study years (30min)

a) Describe your project in 3-4 sentences / one minute. Tell us what the project is about, what it does, and how it technically works.

b) Try to answer these questions:

- What positive qualities can you see in it?
- What did you afterwards realize could have worked better?
- How did you feel about your learning process doing this project? Did you feel confident, did you enjoy the process, and what did you learn?
- If you would do it again, would you proceed differently? If yes/no, how and why?

**8 minutes** for preparing, **2 minutes** each for presenting.

## 2) Website as a Narrative Experience (30min)

Visit an (assigned) website and review describe its experience. Write it in **max 75 words** (use [wordcounter.net](https://wordcounter.net) to count words). Consider **appearance**, **movement**, **structure** and **navigation**. Use a descriptive writing style, with no subjects. *The word bank and assigned websites are in the annex below.* Suggestion: less words and precise words, is more.

After, each student reads its prompt to the group. After all prompts are read, websites are presented in a second table turn.

**8 minutes** for writing, **2 minutes** each for presenting.

```

A monochrome website with a classic appearance. 
A subtle touch of functional fantasy for the navigation. 
Few variations in terms of size, almost typological in look.
Very static feel and standard structure.
Neutral, dry, vernacular or generous? 

Clear and obvious structure and information.
Thousands of content elements all accessible as a long list 
Several filtering through categories and sorting options. 
Items can be added to your basket. 
But it feels more like an archive, a catalog.

## 3) The Good, The Bad, and the... (30min)

This time, you'll be assigned a website and will be assigned either to take the 'good' (positive/supportive) side or the 'bad' (negative/critical) side. Please elaborate on the five points below, with one (short) sentence each. For each points, are the solution 'adequate' according to you and how it 'should' be (in terms of affordance). Try to convince us, but also be *fair play* ;)

1. Appearance
2. Movement
3. Structure
4. Navigation
5. Functionality (does it do what it should)
6. Accessibility

After you have your points ready, the website will be made visible to the rest of the group and both sides will, in a exchange, present their points. Then, the group will vote on whether the *good* or *bad* has convinced its audience.

**8 minutes** for writing, **3 minutes** per website presentation.
