# Introductory / writing assignments

A quick assignment for presenting eachâ€™s thesis, beyond the previous *abstract* (1-2h?)

## A website as a written experience

Note: use a descriptive writing style, with no subjects. See examples.

### 1. Narrow it down.

Write in **two** sentences.

- Subject (a name, or a combination of select words, the studied *object*)
- Tone (personal, distanced, analytical, lyrical, light, deep, digressive, focused)
- Methodology (academic study, enumeration-comparison, field study, autoethnography, creative writing, (speculative) fiction)
- Reference material (if the study subject features one proheminently that is unavoidable to the understanding of the topic)
- Flow (chronological, nonlinear, slow, fast-paced, punctuated, repetition-driven, emphasising, understating)
- Stance / closure (opinionated, revendicative, precautious, nuanced, belief-in-facts, embracing the conundrum, optimistic, pessimistic)

Example:

```
A first-person, light and slightly digressive back-and-forth personal-historical inquiry 
on the relationship between chronometry as a field of interest/technology and the labouring body. 

A punctuation of historical technological milestones intertwined with a selection of expanded
personal familial observations that is interrogative by nature, yet offering no precise roadmap.
```
