# Introductory / writing assignments

A quick assignment for presenting each’s thesis, beyond the previous *abstract* (1-2h?)

## A website as a written experience

### 1. Narrow it down. (8 min) (+8 min group read)

Write in **a few ultrashort** sentences (max 10-12 words). Use a descriptive writing style, with no subjects.

- Subject (a name, or a combination of select words, the studied *object*)
- Tone (personal, distanced, analytical, lyrical, light, deep, digressive, focused)
- Methodology (academic study, enumeration-comparison, field study, autoethnography, creative writing, (speculative) fiction)
- Reference material (if the study subject features one proheminently that is unavoidable to the understanding of the topic)
- Flow (chronological, nonlinear, slow, fast-paced, punctuated, repetition-driven, emphasising, understating)
- Stance / closure (opinionated, revendicative, precautious, nuanced, belief-in-facts, embracing the conundrum, optimistic, pessimistic)

Example:

```
A first-person, slightly digressive back-and-forth.
An inquiry on chronometry and the labouring body. 
A punctuation of historical technological milestones.
And personal familial observations.
Interrogative by nature – no precise roadmap.
```

### 2. See, structure, navigate (10 min) (+15 min group read)

Write in **max 150 words** a visiting experience (featuring your thesis). Consider **appearance**, **movement**, **structure** and **navigation**. Use a descriptive writing style, with no subjects.

**Appearance**:

- Big / small
- Colourful / monochrome
- Expanded / compressed
- Hidden / hypervisible
- Centered / sideways
- Soft / hard
- Liquid / solid
- Warm / cold
- Personal / apersonal
- Vernacular / corporate
- Smooth / cumbersome
- Generous / clinical
- Accumulated / selected / distiled

**Movement**:

- Quick / slow
- Subtle / proheminent
- Directional / adirectional
- Linear / bouncy
- Incremental / repetitive / once
- Simple / excessive
- Reactive / unreactive
- Solicited / intrusive

**Structure:**

- Ordered / unordered
- Chronology / deambulation
- Tree (multiple levels) / all flat (one level)
- Top-bottom / sideway
- Indexed / unindexed
- Categorized / uncategorized
- Explicit (structure) / concealed (structure)

**Navigation:**

- A button / a toggle / a list of choices
- From A to B / from any to any
- From top to bottom / from sideways to sideways
- Linear navigation / navigation through associations
- Expanding and contracting apparatuses (like accordions)
- A table of contents
- A site map
- A glossary / an index of terms / definitions
- Navigational breadcrumbs
- Sticky stuff
- A *sticky* experience
- Hyper-hyperlinks
- Popups
- A *click*, a *tap*, a *mouseover*, a *mousedown*, a combination of trigger *events*.
- Stuff on *scroll*, stuff on *resize*, stuff on *device flip*.
- Go to (...), back to (...), previous, next
- Categories / categorizing / tags
- Hamburgers
- Place and time
- Sounds / your voice (speech-based)
- Means of connection (an IP address)
- User input is data
- Bars / stacks
- Vertical scrolling / Horizontal scrolling
- State of progress (you are here, you are at X%)

```
Everything on the same level of hierarchy, and monochrome.
Neither hard nor soft, but kind of impersonal. 
It’s kind of distilled, but it’s not about being straight to the point. 
It’s efficient yet it doesn’t provide with candies.

Movement is sharp, like a tickling clock. 
It goes only in one direction. 
There is no way back. 
It’s incremental, intrusive.

The navigation is linear and the progress becomes visible while navigating.
Maybe it only scrolls in one direction? Going back seems painful.
Think in terms of task completion, its time equivalent, and unlocking ‘features’. 
Kind of being rewarded when reaching a milestone but not really.
```

### 4. Talk elements and properties (15 min) (+15 min group read)

Choose a CSS property and/or selector. Choose a UI pattern or a component type. Combine them. Write a few short sentences to describe how they complement, enhance, or interfere with each other. Use a descriptive writing style, with no subjects.

CSS selectors / properties:

UI patterns / component types:

```
A fixed navigational card acting as controls:  
an IP address, a chronometer, and a list of checkboxes corresponding to ‘chapters’. 

The card has a CSS border on one direction only. 
The direction is changed with a keyframe-animation...
from top-left-bottom-right (1 second each), 
and the colour is changed, 
dimming 100% to 50% to 100% (but no animation) 
within sixty iterations.
```

### 5. Combine it (15 min) (+15 min group read)

Write in **150-200 words** a website experience featuring your thesis work while describing the somatic experience as well as the features used to achieve the experience. Write in first persion (I).

```
I arrive on the website, I ‘punch in’ with my IP address, and a chronometer starts. 
There are checkboxes. I can only click the first one.
An informative prompt appears with the title and informing me on the nature of the website.

The page is monochrome-looking with a tiny hint of accent colours, but nothing very joyful. 
Everything has the same level of hierarchy to the eye, on a medium scale.

I scroll down through a linear writing on a two-column layout, where text sometimes is on the right, 
sometimes on the left, but never on both sides.

I see that I make progress by looking at a (word) counter that estimate how much words I’ve read. 
When there are medias, I have to click / tap over them to show them. 
And when I’m at the bottom, I can only click next.

After I’ve gone through all the sections, it seems like I’m at the end. 
The chronometer stops, the content dissolves and a prompt informs me that the website 
will become accessible to this device again after some time (a 15 minutes break).
```
