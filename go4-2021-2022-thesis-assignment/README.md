#### Mentoring (individual) slots schedule, 1 on 1 (4x, you attend *at least* 2 out of 4):

- 10:30 | 10:50 | 11:10 | 11:30
- 20 min break
- 12:10 | 12:30 | 12:50 | 13:10
- 60 min break

- 13:30 | 14:30 | 15:30 | 16:30

## The assignement

- **Conceptualize, design, and implement** a content-based website &ndash; a publication &ndash; your kabk thesis.
- **Deploy it** on the kabk Github.

*Focus points:*

- Your website is **accessible, legible, and semantically-written** (you use correct `<html>` tags).
- Your website takes into account that more visitors use **mobile devices** than desktop ones (it is actually conceived 'mobile-first', and you've started your design process with mobile screens in mind).
- Your website **loads moderately fast** (information is compressed accordingly and you aren't trying to put .tiff images).
- There's a **relationship between the content of your thesis, its formal aspect, and its navigational/experiential aspect**. (that is, we see a *concept* there)

## Thesis landing page (extra)

- We'll need an extra group to make a landing page for this year's theses. As examples, here are the landing pages of [2021](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-21/), [2020](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-20/), and [2019](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19/). It would be nice to have this sorted out **before spring break**.

## First class

### a.m. (first 30-45min)

- Intro (this document)
- Quick round table presentation
- Setting up of a common etherpad (https://pad.riseup.net/p/PP3ireCyk8PMzu_y-Zzu-keep)

### a.m. / p.m.

Three revolving groups, three blocks of +/- 1h30 to 1h45.

1. François makes a writing exercice. And will then unpacks focus points of a web page (in 2022), discuss methodology with boilerplates, CSS variables, debugging online, touches upon the *footnotes* specificity of the assignment, and hints on *deploying* on Github Pages.
2. Thomas delves into CSS functions, fluid typography as well as *Markdown*.
3. Martijn proposes hands-on exercices on data models / structure.
