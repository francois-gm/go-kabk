## Main assignement

- **Conceptualize, design, and implement** a content-based website &ndash; a publication &ndash; your kabk thesis.
- **Deploy it** on the kabk Github.

*Focus points:*

- Your website is **accessible, legible, and semantically-written** (you use correct `<html>` tags).
- Your website takes into account that more visitors use **mobile devices** than desktop ones (it is actually conceived 'mobile-first', and you've started your design process with mobile screens in mind).
- Your website **loads moderately fast** (information is compressed accordingly and you aren't trying to put .tiff images).
- There's a **relationship between the content of your thesis, its formal aspect, and its navigational/experiential aspect**. (that is, we see a *concept* there)

## Mini/bonus assignment

- **present a website of your choice** in 4 min (*1/2 pecha kucha*, 10 slides of 20sec) x 10 students per session (1h)

## Thesis landing page (extra)

- We'll need an extra group to make a landing page for this year's theses. As examples, here are the landing pages of [2021](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-21/), [2020](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-20/), and [2019](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19/). It would be nice to have this sorted out **before spring break**.

## First class

### a.m.

- Intro (this document)
- Round table presentation
- Setting up of a common etherpad / are.na
- Individual writing exercice + presentation (then dividing the group into sub-groups (4-5 students) based on their thesis subjects / writing styles / interests / possible media treatments (text-based, media-based, etc). Presentation of text-ideas / general concept?)

### p.m.

Presentation of web notions / workshop...

- François unpacks focus points of a web page (in 2022), talks about document structure / boilerplate, gets into a how-to-how of finding help and debugging online, and touches upon the *footnotes* specificity of the assignment).
- Thomas delves into CSS functions (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions), variables, calcs, rems, etc.
- Jekyll + Markdown, work with footnotes
- (how to) deploy on Github Pages
