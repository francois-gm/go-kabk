## The assignement

- **Conceptualize, design, and implement** a content-based website &ndash; a publication &ndash; your kabk thesis.
- **Deploy it** on the kabk Github.

*Focus points:*

- Your website is **accessible, legible, and semantically-written** (you use correct `<html>` tags).
- Your website takes into account that more visitors use **mobile devices** than desktop ones (it is actually conceived 'mobile-first', and you've started your design process with mobile screens in mind).
- Your website **loads moderately fast** (information is compressed accordingly and you aren't trying to put .tiff images).
- There's a **relationship between the content of your thesis, its formal aspect, and its navigational/experiential aspect**. (that is, we see a *concept* there)

## Thesis landing page (extra)

- We'll need an extra group to make a landing page for this year's theses. As examples, here are the landing pages of [2021](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-21/), [2020](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-20/), and [2019](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19/). It would be nice to have this sorted out **before spring break**.
