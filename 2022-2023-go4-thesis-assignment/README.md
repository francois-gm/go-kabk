# Thesis as a webpage assignment

## The assignment

- Conceptualize, design and code a web version of your thesis in the form of a one-pager website.
- Publish (deploy) it on the KABK's GitHub repo.
- Ensure it is archivable on the university's *researchcatalogue.net*.

## Class structure

### Planning

- **Schedule**: (almost) **every Wednesday**, from **December 14th** up to **March 15th**, from **9h** to **17h**.
- **Duration**: **9 classes** spread on 15 weeks.
- **Deadline**: greenlight and digital thesis deadline on **Thursday March 16th**.

### Activities

- Individual feedback (**sign-up** sheet, **15 minutes slots**) on most classes.
- The possibility of making small groups feedback (4-5 people, sign-up sheet, 60 minutes) if the occasion proves useful.
- **Self-directed** (if not meeting for feedback, you'd be expected to advance/work on your project)
- In addition, we aim to schedule, when appropriate, about **one hour** of that class for presenting **relevant** knowledge **related to the assignment**. This will be communicated based on feedback and needs.
- **You don't have to sign-up every week**, but we **suggest** you to sign-up **two classes out of three**. This means you'll meet with François about 3 times out of 9 classes, and Thomas about 3 times out of 9 classes.

### Working methodology

Since this assignment is **concurrent** to the writing of the thesis itself, our working methodology needs to adapt to this reality. Conceptualization, design and programming will have to happen at the same time that your thesis content is being produced. In order to do so, we suggest you to **work with placeholder** or semi-placeholder **content**. Maybe you have a loose structure with temporary titles that give a hint of your direction and theme? You might also have visual content (visual essay content?) that can serve as temporary illustrations within your website?

Questions to ask **now or soon**:

- Which **types of content** would my thesis website need to accomodate? Lots of visual materials, maybe videos, or audio? Most likely some levels of headings, and maybe a table of contents?
- Which **type of writing / tone?** An academic research will command an appropriate use of footnotes. Something akin of a *deambulation* at the edges of theory and fiction might have looser or expressive typographic elements.
- What are my **actual abilities**, in relation to this assignment? Be realistic, and remember that the criterias for succeeding this assignment are based on technical requirements, they should be attainable by each of you and do not necessarily require extensive coding abilities/confidence. We will provide you with ressources and suggestions but in the end you are the one to make your (technical) choices based on your abilities.

Questions to ask **at some point later**:

- **How can my topic can translate into visual design choices?** Shall my topic translate into visual design choices? Which types of ingredients can I play with (*color, typography, layout, interaction patterns...*).
- Which **types of functionalities** could enrich my visitor/reader's experience **without feeling gimmicky**?
- Are my design choices **appropriate for any screen sizes**? Would my website be accessible to most users and most usage contexts?

Questions to ask **before delivering your project**:

- **Bring your thesis website a test drive**. Navigate and reflect on your experience. Also let your friends try your website, and observe them while doing it. Criterias to take into account: *intuitive patterns, loads fast, optimized content and media, legible sizes depending on screen sizes, right timing for animations and transitions, accessible...* Based on these experiences, see remaining details that can be improved.
- Can my thesis website be **archived** through the university research portal (assignment requirement) 

### Milestones

↓ (December) You're familiar with your thesis topic and your angle of resarch, you have conceptual ideas of *potentialities*. <br>
↓ (December) You are organizing your working content for the assignment (placeholder materials). <br>
↓ (January) You have ideas related to the structure, navigation, visual appearance and effects. You started collecting references (*codepens, CSStricks, are.na, etc*) that could help you. <br>
↓ (January) You have design sketches and/or code sketches <br>
↓ (end January) You've left the world of static design and are fully committed to **coding/developing your actual thesis webpage.** <br>
↓ (mid February) Your website is structurally sound, you are now adjusting elements more precisely. <br>
↓ (March) You've replaced your placeholder content by your actual content.
↓ (March) You are debugging / fine-tuning details across several screen sizes (mobile/desktop), and you are deploying on GitHub. <br>
↓ (mid March) (deadline) **Your website is online (yay!)**

## Thesis landing page (non-graded)

- We'll need a small group to make a landing page for this year's theses. As examples, here are the landing pages of [2021](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-21/), [2020](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-20/), and [2019](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19/). It would be nice to have this sorted out **before spring break**.
