# Describing web experiences

A quick exercice about looking at and describing web experiences

## 1) Website as a Narrative Experience

Visit an (assigned) website and review describe its experience. Write it in **max 250 words**. Consider **appearance**, **movement**, **structure** and **navigation**. Use a descriptive writing style, with no subjects. See below for website list (don't open them please)

After, each student reads its prompt to the group, and after it is read, the website is presented.

```

A monochrome website with a classic appearance. 
A subtle touch of functional fantasy: a saturated accent color for navigational devices. 
A little 'unicode' heart as language, a quote in serif are warm touches... 
Few variations in terms of size, almost typological in look. 
It's ambivalent whether this is neutral, dry, vernacular or generous? 
Textual differentiations are minimal; uppercase and normal case, 
but regardless the structure and the information is obvious and clear. 
The website has very few text animations, subtle and barely noticeable. 

Thousands of content occurences are accessible as a long list 
with several filtering through categories and sorting options. 
The emphasis is on the experience of browsing through items that can be added to your basket. 
Items can be bought but it feels more like an archive, a library, a catalog.
The structure is conventional, and navigation happens mostly 'top to bottom', but not only.
