Everything on the same level of hierarchy, and monochrome.
Neither hard nor soft, but kind of impersonal. 
It’s kind of distilled, but it’s not about being straight to the point. 

Movement is sharp, like a tickling clock. 
It goes only in one direction. 
There is no way back. 
It’s incremental, intrusive.

The navigation is linear and the progress becomes visible while navigating.
Maybe it only scrolls in one direction? Going back seems painful.
Think in terms of task completion, its time equivalent, and unlocking ‘features’. 
Kind of being rewarded when reaching a milestone but not really.
