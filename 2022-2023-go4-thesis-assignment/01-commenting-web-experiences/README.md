# Commenting web experiences

## The good, the bad and the... (10min)

### 1. Analyse a website and describe your navigation experience.

a) find only *positive* qualities.
b) find only *negative* qualities.

### 2. See, structure, navigate (10 min) (+6 min group read)

Write in **max 150 words** a visiting experience. Consider **appearance**, **movement**, **structure** and **navigation**. Use a descriptive writing style, with no subjects.

**Appearance**:

- Big / small
- Colourful / monochrome
- Expanded / compressed
- Hidden / hypervisible
- Centered / sideways
- Soft / hard
- Liquid / solid
- Warm / cold
- Personal / apersonal
- Vernacular / corporate
- Smooth / cumbersome
- Generous / clinical
- Accumulated / selected / distiled

**Movement**:

- Quick / slow
- Subtle / proheminent
- Directional / adirectional
- Linear / bouncy
- Incremental / repetitive / once
- Simple / excessive
- Reactive / unreactive
- Solicited / intrusive

**Structure:**

- Ordered / unordered
- Chronology / deambulation
- Tree (multiple levels) / all flat (one level)
- Top-bottom / sideway
- Indexed / unindexed
- Categorized / uncategorized
- Explicit (structure) / concealed (structure)

**Navigation:**

- A button / a toggle / a list of choices
- From A to B / from any to any
- From top to bottom / from sideways to sideways
- Linear navigation / navigation through associations
- Expanding and contracting apparatuses (like accordions)
- A table of contents
- A site map
- A glossary / an index of terms / definitions
- Navigational breadcrumbs
- Sticky stuff
- A *sticky* experience
- Hyper-hyperlinks
- Popups
- A *click*, a *tap*, a *mouseover*, a *mousedown*, a combination of trigger *events*.
- Stuff on *scroll*, stuff on *resize*, stuff on *device flip*.
- Go to (...), back to (...), previous, next
- Categories / categorizing / tags
- Hamburgers
- Place and time
- Sounds / your voice (speech-based)
- Means of connection (an IP address)
- User input is data
- Bars / stacks
- Vertical scrolling / Horizontal scrolling
- State of progress (you are here, you are at X%)

```
Everything on the same level of hierarchy, and monochrome.
Neither hard nor soft, but kind of impersonal. 
It’s kind of distilled, but it’s not about being straight to the point. 
It’s efficient yet it doesn’t provide with candies.

Movement is sharp, like a tickling clock. 
It goes only in one direction. 
There is no way back. 
It’s incremental, intrusive.

The navigation is linear and the progress becomes visible while navigating.
Maybe it only scrolls in one direction? Going back seems painful.
Think in terms of task completion, its time equivalent, and unlocking ‘features’. 
Kind of being rewarded when reaching a milestone but not really.
```

### 5. Combine it (15 min) (+10 min group read)

Write in **150-200 words** a website experience featuring your thesis work while describing the somatic experience as well as the features used to achieve the experience. Write in first persion (I).

```
I arrive on the website, I ‘punch in’ with my IP address, and a chronometer starts. 
There are checkboxes. I can only click the first one.
An informative prompt appears and I'm informed by the nature of my visit.

I scroll down through linear text on a two-column layout.
Sometimes is on the right, sometimes on the left, but never on both sides simultaneously.

I see my progress by looking at a (word) counter that estimate how much words I’ve read. 
When there are medias, I have to click / tap over them to show them. 
And when I’m at the bottom, I can only click 'next' (you can't go *back* in time).

After I’ve gone through all the sections, I'm at the *end*.
The chronometer stops, the content dissolves and a prompt informs me that the website 
will become accessible only after a 15 minutes break.
```
