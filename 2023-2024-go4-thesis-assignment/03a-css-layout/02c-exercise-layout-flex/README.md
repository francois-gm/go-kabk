# CSS flex exercise

## a) Open this document, and let's do some layout changes...

(*document has 12 blocks, relatively positionned*)

- Change the display property value to **`flex`**.
- Add **`flex-direction: row;`**.
- Can you reverse the order of the content?
- Add spacing between the elements?
- Center the blocks vertically and horizontally?
- Push half of the blocks at the beginning and half at the end of the page?
- How about the layout becomes one column on smaller screen, but multi-column on bigger screen?
